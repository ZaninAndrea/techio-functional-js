# Recursion
A recursive function is a function that **calls itself** until it hits a **base case**, this is often used in recursive languages as a replacement for loops, as it is far more flexible.

Just to understand the concept let's implement a countdown as a recursive function:

@[Countdown]({ "stubs": ["recursion/countdown.js"], "command": "node recursion/countdown.js" })
